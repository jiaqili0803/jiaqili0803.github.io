## <a id="about-me"></a>About Me

Hello, I am Jiaqi (Ella) Li. I am currently a Master's student at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan School of Information</a>. I am working on my Master's Thesis with <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/jeff-sheng" target="_blank">Dr. Jeff Sheng</a> and <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/clifford-lampe" target="_blank">Dr. Cliff Lampe</a>, focusing on the online and offline lives of Chinese Queer People and their community challenges. During my graduate studies, I have also had the opportunity to work on some research projects with several outstanding professors: <a href="http://sunyoungpark.weebly.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Sun Young Park</a>, <a href="https://webpage.pace.edu/zzhang/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Zhan Zhang</a>, <a href="https://pdhillon.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Paramveer Dhillon</a>, <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/people/vg-vinod-vydiswaran" target="_blank">Dr. VG Vinod Vydiswaran</a>, <a href="https://rpunzalan.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ricky Punzalan</a>, <a href="https://www.jesseajohnston.net/" target="_blank">Dr. Jesse Johnston</a>, and <a href="https://xintong.ca/" target="_blank">Dr. Xin Tong</a>. Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Liverpool</a>.

In addition to being an HCI researcher in academia, I also work in data science and UX research.

In my free time, I'm deeply passionate about participating in a variety of volunteering and community activities (e.g., <a href="https://esc.umich.edu/graduate-researchers/" target="_blank">Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC)</a> Affiliated Researcher, <a href="https://midas.umich.edu/student-community/" target="_blank">MIDAS Student Leadership Board Member</a>, General Committee of STEM Women Club, <a href="https://www.uschinahealthsummit.org/" target="_blank">Volunteer of U.S.-China Health Summit</a>, <a href="https://kidscan.org.uk/" target="_blank">Volunteer of Kidscan Children's Cancer Research</a>) to help advance social justice, I also enjoy enriching my life with activities like kickboxing, karaoke, music festivals, and beatboxing!

## <a id="research-interests"></a>Research Interests

My research interests focus on **understanding how equitable and inclusive technology should be designed for marginalized populations, with the goal of promoting their health equity and wellbeing, especially those who are often overlooked in technology design due to their intersectional identities** (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, citizenship, ability). My research interests extend beyond health technologies to encompass social, cultural, environmental, and ethical factors that affect people's well-being. This involves both studying and designing comprehensive sociotechnical systems (e.g., social media and data/technical infrastructures) to better support marginalized individuals' needs.

As a Queer, Asian, and international woman, I am personally and professionally aware of systemic inequalities that deepen the marginalization of vulnerable groups. I aim to support the needs and well-being of marginalized people by leveraging the lessons learned living my intersectional identity in academia.

## <a id="methods-skills"></a>Methods and Skills

I am interested in and have research experience leveraging mixed methods.
<!-- I am interested in and have research experience leveraging mixed methods. In my future work, I will continue to use qualitative methods such as interviews, participatory design (PD), community-based participatory research (CBPR), and ethnography to involve marginalized individuals while applying critical theories, including feminist, queer, and decolonial theories. Furthermore, I will utilize my skills in statistical analysis and computing for tasks such as quantitative analysis (survey, experiments) and software development. Through diverse approaches, I aspire to address different kinds of research questions.-->

- **Computing**: Python, R, MySQL, Git, Statistical Analysis, Front-End Development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS); Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Dask, Spark, NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, XGBoost, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Keras, LSTM, BERT, lxml, ElementTree, BeautifulSoup, etc

- **Research**: Survey, Interview, Observation, Contextual Design, Usability Testing, Experiments, Participatory Design, Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), Experimental Design, Open Coding, Affinity Diagram, Thematic Analysis, Content Analysis

- **Tools**: Overleaf, Zotero, Nvivo, Dedoose, Qualtrics, Google Forms, UX Design Tools (Figma, Miro, Lucidspark, etc)
